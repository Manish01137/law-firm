                    <p id="para1">You are our family and we will help you like we help our own family members. This means having your best long-term interests in mind as we negotiate, compromise, settle or resolve your matter in Court if need be. Separation is emotionally and financial exhausting. We try our best not to add to it by putting you and your spouse in a fighting ring to battle out your differences and have your children watch. We would rather communicate, negotiate and reach an amicable solution that you will be proud of for the rest of your life. </p>
                    <p id="para2">We invite you to give us the opportunity to address your case and the possible solutions even if you do not end up retaining us. <b>We do not ask you to choose us. We ask you to choose the right lawyer. Whether that is us or someone else is irrelevant.</b> We invite you to consult with a couple of family lawyers prior to choosing who you better connect with. We charge for our initial consultation because we want serious clients who know of us and trust us before they come in. If you have to pay for something, you will spend much more time looking into it, qualifying it and determining whether it is worth the money or whether you really need it. We do not need to or want to give incentives such as a free consultation to lure clients into retaining us. Our quality of advice and work should do that job which again are ingredients to successful cases and good relationships.</p>
